## Self-curation

Every user is allowed to use all registered resources and places to organize events there. When organizing an event, the requested place and resource will be blocked for the selected timeframe.

Please note that there is no authorization process, the requested resources and places are automatically confirmed when being available. Please use the internal messenger tool to write to that person if you have further questions towards the use of your resources or places.

### Manage resources

Resources can simply be anything you want to share with others so they can realize theire events: It can be **skills** (playing an instrument, being good at finding something on the internet, helping to prepare food, etc.), real **physical items** (your keyboard, a PA system, projector or rubber boat) or **anything else you can think of**.

![Der Markt](/images/resources.png)

Click on `Der Markt` (*"The market"*) when you want to list all available resources. Click `Create Resources` if you want to register a new one. Just fill out a title for your resource, add a short description about it (for example details about usage or where to pick it up), upload an image and click `Done` when ready.

![Create a new resource](/images/new-resource.png)

Your registered resource is now available for everyone else to be used. You will receive an notification message in your inbox and email when someone requested it for an event. You can contact that person via the internal message system to coordinate all further steps.

### Manage places

Places can be understood as venues which host events. When you register a place you make it available and usable to all other participants.

A place on HOFFNUNG 3000 can be:

* An **address** (like "official" places with a streetname, number etc.)
* A **GPS** position (which gives you the chance to make "everything" a place)
* A **virtual** space (for dreaming)

Click `Places` in the menu to list all currently available places. Click `Create Place` to register your own.

You will be asked to fill in a title and a longer description of your place, upload a few pictures so others can see what it is about. Define under `Where is it` how others can find it: Select a GPS position by clicking on the map, define a normal adress or select  virtual space.

![Where is it?](/images/create-place.png)

Define if your place is `public` or `private`. If you make your place private it won't be visible to unregistrated users and visitors with tickets. Only participants will be able to see it in the calendar. Every event which will be organized in your private place will also automatically be private.

![Where is it?](/images/create-place-2.png)

Places offer time slots which then can be booked by others for theire events. You define how long a single slot is under `How long is one slot?`, just move the slider around, the duration might have a big impact on how people will use your space (think about a whole exhibition setup or a 5 minute action poem reading).

Additionally you can disable slots by clicking `Edit slots` under `Manage available slots`. Depending on your selected slot size you can click the slots now to turn them on or off. Disabled slots can't be booked by others.

![Define slots](/images/slot-editor.png)

Please note that it is not possible to change the slot size after you created your place but you can still enable/disable single slots when they haven't been booked yet.

Click `Done!` to finally register the place in the platform. You will automatically receive a message and email when someone requests it for an event.

### Manage events

Under `Calendar` you find all created events by all users. Click on the single events to find more informations about them. Only registrated users can see these details and only participants can see private events.

Click `Create Event` to register your own in the calendar. You will be asked to fill out a title and description for the event, please upload a few pictures as well.

Click `Select a place` and choose from the list of all places which have been registrated so far. If you miss your needed place in that list, [register it](#manage-places) yourself before.

![Create new event](/images/create-event.png)

After selecting a place you can book one or more time slots from it, just make sure your needed time slots are not taken yet (they will appear red if so) or have been disabled by the owner (greyed out). You can't choose timeslots which are not in closed order.

![Select time slots](/images/select-slots.png)

Please define now if your event is `public` or `private`. If you choose a private place your event will automatically be marked as private, which means it will only be visible to other participants and not visitors.

Click `Select Resources` to book things you need to realize your event. The items on the right hand side are all registrated resources of the platform, on the left you find the ones you selected for your event. Click `Add` to move a resource to your side. Some resources might be in use at your defined time, they will be marked as `Not available` then. Click `Remove` if you want to unselect a resource.

![Select resources](/images/select-resources.png)

To finalize your event click `Save event`. It will be registrated in the calendar and all regarding place and resource owners are notified now about your requests. Please contact them by clicking on theire names if you have further questions.

## Sidebar

The sidebar to the right holds all *social* features of the platform like messaging, activities of others, the random meeting feature or documentation tools.

![The sidebar](/images/sidebar.png)

### Inbox and messages

The internal messaging system enables you to ask other participants about their resources, places and events. Just click on a name of a user and the messenger will automatically start a new conversation or open an already existing one.

![Write a new message](/images/new-message.png)

When you receive a new message you will get notified with a little rainbow box and the upper right circle will turn outlined.

Click on `Inbox` in the sidebar to get an overview of all your current conversations.

### Activity stream

To get an overview about what is currently happening on the platform you can check out the activity stream by opening the sidebar. The latest activites are displayed there. To see them all you can click `All activities`.

Here you will see when someone created, updated or deleted a resource, event or place. You will also get notified about random meetings or new messages.

![Activity stream](/images/activity-stream.png)

### Random meetings

Random meetings are exactly what you think: A random meeting with random participants at a random place. The only thing you can narrow down is a time.

Open the sidebar and select a preferred time under `Random meetings`. Select `Anytime` if you just want to find the next available one.

Click `Request random meeting`. HOFFNUNG 3000 will check if there is already a random meeting being created in the requested time, if not it will create a new one for you.

With a random meeting a new conversation is automatically created for you. In this conversation you will get notified about the final time and place. All other participants who joined in will also join that conversation. Use this to prepare yourself for the random meeting :-)

### .gif stream

The gif stream is a special way to document the whole festival by making use of all participant cameras installed in theire tablets, smartphones or notebooks.

By starting the stream you will be asked to authorize permissions to use the camera so the plattform can take a picture every 10 seconds. All taken pictures are slowly processed into a gif. This gif will be visible under `Stream` in the main navigation and visible to all other participants and visitors.

Please note that it takes a little while until your images are visible.
