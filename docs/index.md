HOFFNUNG 3000 is a web-based [platform](http://github.com/adzialocha/hoffnung3000) on which participants organize the festival themselves by offering and sharing and using everyone’s abilities / potentials / gear / skills. The idea was and is, that all these resources form a diverse pool of potentiality and it is from these resources that all activity and production derive. The festival is created by everyone’s collective endeavour.

HOFFNUNG 3000 was also a festival for music, art and theory in Berlin initiated by [BLATT 3000](https://blatt3000.de) together with [KLANGkELLER](http://klangkeller.net/) in [Berlin 2017](https://soundcloud.com/thelakeradio/a-portrait-of-blatt-3000). It was an experiment in social, artistic and theoretical collaboration.

HOFFNUNG 3000 asks: How do we organize ourselves in our social, artistic & theoretical communities? HOFFNUNG 3000 is not simply a festival but more of a process of organizing a festival, a festival that creates itself. Through each and every participant.

## Features

* Register `resources` (skills, items, etc.) and make them available to other users
* Create `places` (address, gps position or *virtual*) and define time slots, so other users can organize events there
* Organize `events` in `places` and use `resources` of others to realize them
* Users can be anonymized with randomly generated [animal avatars](https://github.com/adzialocha/random-animal-name-generator/)
* Have random meetings with random participants in random places
* Built-in messenger and activity stream
* `events` and `places` can be private (not visible to audience) or public
* [.gif-stream](https://github.com/adzialocha/gif-stream/blob/master/example.gif) documentation tool
