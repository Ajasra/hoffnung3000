HOFFNUNG 3000 was a festival for music, art and theory in Berlin initiated by [BLATT 3000](https://blatt3000.de) together with [KLANGkELLER](http://klangkeller.net/) in [Berlin 2017](https://soundcloud.com/thelakeradio/a-portrait-of-blatt-3000). It was an experiment in social, artistic and theoretical collaboration.

HOFFNUNG 3000 is also a [platform](http://github.com/adzialocha/hoffnung3000) on which participants organize the festival themselves by offering and sharing and using everyone’s abilities / potentials / gear / skills. The idea was and is, that all these resources form a diverse pool of potentiality and it is from these resources that all activity and production derive. The festival is created by everyone’s collective endeavour.

HOFFNUNG 3000 asks: How do we organize ourselves in our social, artistic & theoretical communities? HOFFNUNG 3000 is not simply a festival but more of a process of organizing a festival, a festival that creates itself. Through each and every participant.
